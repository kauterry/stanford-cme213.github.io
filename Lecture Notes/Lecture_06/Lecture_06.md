Quicksort

One of the fastest sorting algorithms

---
class: middle

# Quicksort algorithm

Divide and conquer approach. Divide step:

- Choose a pivot $x$
- Separate sequence into 2 sub-sequences with all elements smaller than $x$ and greater than $x$

Conquer step:

- Sort the two subsequences

        x = A[l]
        s = l

            if A[i] <= x: # Swap entries smaller than pivot
                s = s+1
                A[s], A[i] = A[i], A[s]
        A[s], A[l] = A[l], A[s]

On average, it runs very fast, even faster than mergesort.

It requires no additional memory

Some disadvantages

Worst-case running time is $O(n^2)$ when input is already sorted

Not stable

# Mergesort

1. Subdivide the list into n sub-lists (each with one element).

2. Sub-lists are progressively merged to produce larger ordered sub-lists.

# Parallel mergesort

When there are many sub-lists to merge, the parallel implementation is straightforward: assign each sub-list to a thread.

When we get few but large sub-lists, the parallel merge becomes difficult.

---
class: middle, center

Merging large chunks

Subdivide the merge into several smaller merges that can be done concurrently.

# Bucket and sample sort

---
class: middle

# Bucket sort

Sequence of integers in the interval $[a,b]$

1. Split $[a,b]$ into $p$ sub-intervals
2. Move each element to the appropriate bucket (prefix sum)
3. Sort each bucket in parallel!

---
class: center, middle

Problem: how should we split the interval in bucket sort? 

This process may lead to intervals that are unevenly filled.

Improved version: splitter sort.

# Sorting networks

Building block: compare-and-exchange (COEX)

In sorting networks, the sequence of COEX is **independent** of the data

One of their advantages: very regular data access

There is a fast algorithm to partially "sort" a bitonic sequence

Bitonic *compare*

---
class: middle, center

Input: bitonic sequence

# Bitonic compare

First half

$\min(E\_0,E\_{n/2}), \min(E\_1,E\_{n/2+1}), \ldots, \min(E\_{n/2-1},E\_{n-1})$

Second half

$\max(E\_0,E\_{n/2}), \max(E\_1,E\_{n/2+1}), \ldots, \max(E\_{n/2-1},E\_{n-1})$

Output

Two bitonic sequences

Left is smaller than right

---
class: middle

Build a bitonic sorting network to sort the entire array

Process:

1. Start from small bitonic sequences
2. Use compare and merge to get longer bitonic sequences
3. Repeat until sorted

Outer `i` loop cannot be parallelized

Step 1: parallelize `j` loop

`for (int j = 0; j < n; j += i)`

Call `BitonicSortSeq(...)` inside `j` loop

---
class: middle

Step 2: split `i` loop into small chunks and large chunks

`for (int i = 2; i <= chunk; i <<= 1){}`

`for (int i = chunk << 1; i <= n; i <<= 1){}`

---
class: middle, center

![](bitonic_sort.png)

---
class: middle

Step 3: large-chunk `i` loop

`for (int i = chunk << 1; i <= n; i <<= 1)`

Call `BitonicSortPar(j, i, seq, up, chunk)`

---
class: middle

`BitonicSortPar()`

`split_length` is very large

Step 4: parallelize `i` loop in `BitonicSortPar()`

`for (int i = start; i < start + split_length; i++)`

---
class: middle

Ultimately fails when `split_length` becomes small again

Step 5: recursively call `BitonicSortPar` only if `split_length > chunk`

Add 

`if (split_length > chunk){}` 

around the two recursive calls to `BitonicSortPar()`

---

class: middle

Code is now wrong; one more pass is needed!

Go back to the `i` loop 

`for (int i = chunk << 1; i <= n; i <<= 1){}`

in `main()`

---
class: middle

Step 6: add

```
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int j = 0; j < n; j += chunk)
{
    bool up = ((j / i) % 2 == 0);
    BitonicSortSeq(j, chunk, seq, up);
}
```

at the end of the `i` loop block

`for (int i = chunk << 1; i <= n; i <<= 1){}`

---
class: middle, center

The exercise is complete

Your code should now produce the correct result!
